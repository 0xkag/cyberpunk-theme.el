Cyberpunk Theme
===============

Cyberpunk color theme for the emacs 24+ built-in color theme support known loosely as <code>deftheme</code>. The theme is <i>mostly</i> a direct port of the [overtone/emacs-live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live) (designed originally for the <code>color-theme</code> package). Many mode-specific customizations, listed below, have also been added.

Installation
============

Ensure that cyberpunk-theme.el is on the custom-theme-load-path like this: 

```lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/path/to/cyberpunk-theme.el")
```

You can then load the theme at any time by running the command <code>M-x load-theme</code> and entering cyberpunk when prompted for "load custom theme: "

If you want cyberpunk-theme to be set at startup, add the following line to your .emacs init file:

```lisp
(load-theme 'cyberpunk t)
```
